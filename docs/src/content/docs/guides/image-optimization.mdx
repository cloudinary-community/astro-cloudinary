Optimization plays a critical role in making your website load as fast as possible.

With the CldImage component, your images will be automatically optimized with automatic
compression and by delivering the most efficient format based on your browser or device
(WebP, AVIF, etc).

:::tip
You can further optimize delivery with [responsive sizing](/guides/responsive-images) by using the `sizes` prop.

## Example

<HeaderImage>
  <CldImage
    width="960"
    height="600"
    src="samples/balloons"
    sizes="100vw"
    alt="Turtle"
  />
</HeaderImage>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="CldImage">
    <CodeBlock>
```jsx copy
import { CldImage } from 'astro-cloudinary';

<CldImage
  width="960"
  height="600"
  src="<Your Public ID>"
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="<Description>"
/>
```
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="getCldImageUrl">
    <CodeBlock>
```jsx copy
import { getCldImageUrl } from 'astro-cloudinary/helpers';

getCldImageUrl({
  width: 960,
  height: 600,
  src: '<Your Public ID>'
});
```
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Prioritizing Critical Images

For images that are critical to page load (like hero images), you can improve performance by using `fetchpriority="high"` and `loading="eager"` to prioritize their loading and improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

<CodeBlock>
```jsx
<CldImage
  src="<Your Public ID>"
  width="1920"
  height="1080"
  alt="<Description>"
  sizes="100vw"
  fetchpriority="high"
  loading="eager"
/>
```
</CodeBlock>

:::note
Learn more about when and how to prioritize images in the [Image Performance & LCP guide](/guides/image-performance-lcp).
