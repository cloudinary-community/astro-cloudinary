Astro Cloudinary provides a seamless way to integrate Cloudinary's powerful upload capabilities into your Astro project. This guide will show you how to use the `CldUploadWidget` component to add upload functionality to your application.

## CldUploadWidget Component

The `CldUploadWidget` component is a wrapper around Cloudinary's Upload Widget, specifically optimized for Astro projects. It allows you to easily add upload functionality with minimal configuration.

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the `CldUploadWidget`:

<CodeBlock>
```astro copy

import { CldUploadWidget } from 'astro-cloudinary';

<CldUploadWidget uploadPreset="your_upload_preset">
  <Button>Upload to Cloudinary</Button>
</CldUploadWidget>
```
</CodeBlock>

Replace "your_upload_preset" with your actual Cloudinary upload preset.

### Live Example
Here's a live example of the CldUploadWidget in action:

<DemoUploadWidgetSigned uploadPreset="astro-cloudinary-signed" signatureEndpoint="/api/sign-cloudinary-params">
  <Button class="cursor-pointer">Upload to Cloudinary</Button>
</DemoUploadWidgetSigned>

:::note
All files uploaded in this demo will be deleted.
:::

### Signed Uploads
For enhanced security, you can use signed uploads. This requires setting up a server-side endpoint to sign the upload parameters.

<CodeBlock>
```astro copy

import { CldUploadWidget } from 'astro-cloudinary';

<CldUploadWidget
  uploadPreset="your_upload_preset"
  signatureEndpoint="/api/sign-cloudinary-params"
>
  <Button>Secure Upload</Button>
</CldUploadWidget>
```
</CodeBlock>

You'll need to create an API route to handle the signature. Here's an example of how your API route might look:

<CodeBlock>
```typescript copy
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";
import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";
export const post: APIRoute = async ({ request }) => {
const body = await request.json();
const { paramsToSign } = body;
const signature = cloudinary.utils.api_sign_request(
paramsToSign,
process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
);
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ signature }), {
status: 200,
headers: {
"Content-Type": "application/json",
},
});
};
```
</CodeBlock>

## Configuration Options

The `CldUploadWidget` component accepts several props for customization:

- `uploadPreset`: (Required) Your Cloudinary upload preset
- `signatureEndpoint`: (Optional) Endpoint for signed uploads
- `onUpload`: Callback function triggered after a successful upload
- `onError`: Callback function triggered if an error occurs during upload

For a full list of options, refer to the [CldUploadWidget Configuration](/clduploadwidget/configuration) page.

## Best Practices and Tips

1. Always use upload presets to control what can be uploaded to your Cloudinary account.
2. Implement signed uploads for enhanced security, especially in production environments.
3. Use the `onUpload` callback to handle successful uploads, such as displaying the uploaded image or updating your application state.
4. Customize the upload widget to match your application's design using CSS.
5. Consider implementing upload restrictions (file types, sizes) using Cloudinary's upload presets.
